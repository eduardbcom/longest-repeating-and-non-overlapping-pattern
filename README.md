# longest-repeating-and-non-overlapping-subpart
## Implementation of the algorithm to find the longest repeating and non overlapping subpart.

### Examples:

```
  const findLongestRepeatedSubpart = require('longest-repeating-and-non-overlapping-substring');

  findLongestRepeatedSubpart('IPPIPPII') === 'IPP'
  findLongestRepeatedSubpart('IPPIP') === 'IP'
  findLongestRepeatedSubpart('IPPIPPIP') === 'IPP'
```
